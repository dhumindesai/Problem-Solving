Problem Statement #
Given two lists of intervals, find the intersection of these two lists. Each list consists of disjoint intervals sorted on their start time.

Example 1:

Input: arr1=[[1, 3], [5, 6], [7, 9]], arr2=[[2, 3], [5, 7]]
Output: [2, 3], [5, 6], [7, 7]
Explanation: The output list contains the common intervals between the two lists.


Example 2:

Input: arr1=[[1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 12]], arr2=[[5, 10]]
Output: [5, 7], [9, 10]
Explanation: The output list contains the common intervals between the two lists.


Time complexity #
As we are iterating through both the lists once, the time complexity of the above algorithm is O(N + M)O(N+M), where â€˜Nâ€™ and â€˜Mâ€™ are the total number of intervals in the input arrays respectively.

Space complexity #
Ignoring the space needed for the result list, the algorithm runs in constant space O(1)O(1).
